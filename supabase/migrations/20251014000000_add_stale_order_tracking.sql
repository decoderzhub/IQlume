/*
  # Add Stale Order Tracking to Grid Orders

  1. Purpose
    - Reduce order_fill_monitor log spam by tracking which orders have been checked
    - Implement intelligent filtering to avoid repeatedly checking old/invalid orders
    - Improve query performance with proper indexing

  2. Changes
    - Add `last_checked_at` timestamp to track when order was last verified with Alpaca
    - Add `check_count` integer to count failed lookup attempts
    - Add `is_stale` boolean to mark orders that should no longer be actively monitored
    - Create composite index for efficient queries on (status, created_at, is_stale)

  3. Migration Strategy
    - Mark existing orders older than 7 days as stale to immediately reduce monitoring load
    - Initialize check_count to 0 for all existing orders
    - Maintain backward compatibility with existing queries

  4. Benefits
    - Reduces database query load
    - Eliminates repeated "order not found" warnings in logs
    - Improves order_fill_monitor performance
    - Maintains accuracy for recent, active orders
