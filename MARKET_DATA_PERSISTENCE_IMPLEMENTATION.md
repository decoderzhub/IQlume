# Market Data Persistence System Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of a persistent historical market data system that ensures backtesting always has access to data, eliminating "No market data available" errors.

## System Architecture

### 1. Market Data Service (`backend/services/market_data_service.py`)

A comprehensive service that manages all aspects of historical market data:

**Key Features:**
- Automated data population for core symbols (SPY, QQQ, major stocks, etc.)
- Incremental daily updates (only fetches new data since last update)
- Data validation and gap detection with automatic backfilling
- Smart caching with configurable coverage thresholds
- On-demand symbol addition with historical data fetch

**Core Methods:**
- `initialize_data()` - Checks and populates data on first startup
- `populate_initial_data()` - Seeds 2 years of historical data for core symbols
- `populate_daily_update()` - Fetches latest data for all tracked symbols (incremental)
- `validate_and_fix_gaps()` - Detects and fills gaps in historical data
- `fetch_and_store_symbol_data()` - Fetches and stores data for a single symbol
- `check_data_coverage()` - Reports on data availability and quality
- `add_symbol()` - Adds a new symbol to tracking with historical data

**Symbol Coverage:**
- Core Symbols (always maintained): SPY, QQQ, IWM, VTI, VOO, AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, TSLA, META, NVDA, and more
- Extended Symbols: AMD, INTC, NFLX, DIS, sector ETFs, and popular stocks
- Dynamic symbol addition: New symbols automatically added when requested

### 2. Scheduler Integration (`backend/scheduler.py`)

The trading scheduler now includes automated market data maintenance jobs:

**Scheduled Jobs:**

1. **Startup Initialization** (runs once on application start)
   - Checks if historical data exists
   - Populates initial 2 years of data if database is empty
   - Ensures minimum viable data for backtesting

2. **Daily Data Update** (runs at 7 PM EST daily)
   - Updates all tracked symbols with latest data
   - Only fetches new bars since last update (incremental)
   - Logs success/failure for each symbol
   - Typically completes in minutes for ~30-50 symbols

3. **Weekly Data Validation** (runs Sundays at 2 AM EST)
   - Scans all symbols for data gaps (>5 days between records)
   - Automatically backfills detected gaps
   - Ensures data quality and completeness
   - Reports symbols affected and gaps filled

**Scheduler Methods:**
- `initialize_market_data()` - Startup initialization routine
- `update_market_data()` - Daily incremental update job
- `validate_market_data()` - Weekly validation and gap-filling job
- `get_scheduler_status()` - Returns scheduler status including market data metrics

### 3. Enhanced Backtest Engine (`backend/services/backtest_engine.py`)

The backtest engine now has improved data fetching with multiple fallback layers:

**Data Fetching Strategy (3-tier fallback):**

1. **PRIORITY 1: Database Cache** (fastest)
   - Queries `historical_market_data` table first
   - Accepts 90%+ coverage as sufficient (lowered from 95%)
   - Returns immediately if sufficient data found

2. **PRIORITY 2: Live API** (if cache insufficient or missing)
   - Fetches from Alpaca API
   - Automatically caches results for future use
   - Handles API rate limits and errors gracefully

3. **PRIORITY 3: Partial Data Fallback** (last resort)
   - Uses incomplete cached data if API fails
   - Requires minimum 10 bars for meaningful backtest
   - Logs warning about reduced accuracy
   - Better than complete failure

**Improved Error Messages:**
When data is unavailable, the system now provides detailed guidance:
- Lists possible causes (data not populated, invalid symbol, API unavailable)
- Suggests specific solutions (wait for daily update, manual population, symbol validation)
- Includes timing information (when next daily update runs)
- Provides API endpoint for manual data population

### 4. Application Lifecycle (`backend/main.py`)

Market data service is initialized on application startup:

**Initialization Steps:**
1. Load environment variables
2. Initialize Supabase client
3. Create StockHistoricalDataClient with system-level Alpaca credentials
4. Initialize MarketDataService with clients
5. Start scheduler (which triggers initial data check)

**System-Level vs User-Level Access:**
- Market data service uses system-level Alpaca credentials (from environment)
- User backtests use cached data (no user credentials needed)
- Fallback to API uses system credentials, not user credentials
- This ensures data availability independent of individual user authentication

### 5. API Endpoints (`backend/routers/market_data.py`)

New endpoints for monitoring and managing market data:

#### GET `/api/market-data/data-status`
Returns current market data availability:
```json
{
  "available": true,
  "total_symbols": 35,
  "total_records": 87450,
  "symbols": ["SPY", "QQQ", "AAPL", ...],
  "last_updated": "2025-10-20T12:00:00Z"
}
```

#### POST `/api/market-data/populate-historical-data`
Manually trigger data population:
```json
{
  "symbols": ["TSLA", "NVDA"],
  "days_back": 365,
  "timeframe": "1Day"
}
```

Uses MarketDataService for consistent data population across all entry points.

### 6. Frontend Integration

#### New Hook: `useMarketDataStatus` (`src/hooks/api/useMarketDataStatus.ts`)
React hook that:
- Fetches market data status on mount
- Auto-refreshes every 5 minutes
- Provides loading and error states
- Returns symbol list and coverage statistics

#### Enhanced Backtest Modal (`src/components/strategies/BacktestModal.tsx`)

**New Features:**

1. **Data Availability Indicator**
   - Green banner: Symbol has historical data cached
   - Amber banner: Limited data availability (will attempt API fetch)
   - Shows symbol being tested and system-wide statistics
   - Lists currently tracked symbols

2. **Enhanced Error Display**
   - Clear error messages with multiple lines
   - Preserves whitespace and formatting from backend
   - Suggests specific actions to resolve issues
   - Includes context about data population timing

3. **Symbol-Specific Status**
   - Checks if strategy's symbol is in cached data
   - Displays personalized message based on availability
   - Provides reassurance when data is ready
   - Warns when data might be limited

## Data Flow

### First-Time Startup
```
Application Start
    ↓
Initialize MarketDataService with system Alpaca credentials
    ↓
Scheduler starts → initialize_market_data()
    ↓
Check if historical_market_data table has data
    ↓
If empty: populate_initial_data()
    - Fetch 2 years of daily data for CORE_SYMBOLS
    - Insert into historical_market_data table
    - Log progress and results
    ↓
Application ready for backtesting
```

### Daily Update (Automated)
```
Daily at 7 PM EST
    ↓
Scheduler triggers: update_market_data()
    ↓
For each tracked symbol:
    - Query last timestamp in database
    - Calculate start_time = last_timestamp + 1 day
    - Fetch new bars from Alpaca (start_time to now)
    - Upsert into historical_market_data (prevents duplicates)
    ↓
Log: X symbols updated, Y bars added
```

### Weekly Validation (Automated)
```
Sundays at 2 AM EST
    ↓
Scheduler triggers: validate_market_data()
    ↓
For each tracked symbol:
    - Fetch all timestamps ordered by date
    - Check for gaps >5 days between consecutive records
    - If gap found:
        * Fetch data for gap period from Alpaca
        * Insert missing bars into database
    ↓
Log: X gaps filled in Y symbols
```

### Backtest Request (User-Initiated)
```
User clicks "Run Backtest"
    ↓
BacktestEngine._fetch_historical_data()
    ↓
Try: Get cached data from historical_market_data
    - Check coverage (90%+ acceptable)
    - If sufficient → Return cached data ✓
    ↓
If insufficient: Try fetch from Alpaca API
    - Fetch data for date range
    - Cache results in database
    - Return API data ✓
    ↓
If API fails: Use partial cached data (if >10 bars)
    - Log warning about reduced accuracy
    - Return partial data ✓
    ↓
If no data available: Raise detailed error with solutions
```

## Database Schema

### `historical_market_data` Table
Already exists from previous migration. Used for storing all historical price data.

**Key Columns:**
- `symbol` - Stock/ETF symbol (e.g., "SPY")
- `timeframe` - Data granularity (e.g., "1Day")
- `timestamp` - Bar timestamp
- `open`, `high`, `low`, `close`, `volume` - OHLCV data
- `data_source` - Source of data (alpaca, polygon, cached)
- `data_quality` - Quality indicator (verified, unverified, interpolated)

**Indexes:**
- Composite index on `(symbol, timeframe, timestamp)` for fast queries
- Unique constraint on same fields to prevent duplicates

**RLS Policies:**
- Readable by all authenticated users (public market data)
- Writable by authenticated users (for caching)

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# System-level Alpaca credentials for market data service
ALPACA_API_KEY=your_api_key
ALPACA_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key

# Supabase connection
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
```

### Scheduler Timing
All times in America/New_York timezone:
- Daily Update: 7:00 PM (after market close)
- Weekly Validation: Sunday 2:00 AM (low usage time)

Can be adjusted in `backend/scheduler.py`:
```python
CronTrigger(hour=19, minute=0, timezone="America/New_York")  # Daily
CronTrigger(day_of_week='sun', hour=2, minute=0, timezone="America/New_York")  # Weekly
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Check System Status
```bash
GET /api/market-data/data-status
```

Returns:
- Total symbols tracked
- Total data points stored
- List of all symbols with data
- Last update timestamp

### Manual Data Population
```bash
POST /api/market-data/populate-historical-data
{
  "symbols": ["TSLA", "AMD"],
  "days_back": 730,
  "timeframe": "1Day"
}
```

### Scheduler Status
The scheduler status endpoint shows all scheduled jobs including market data jobs:
```bash
GET /api/scheduler/status
```

### Logs
All market data operations are logged with emoji indicators:
- 📊 Data initialization
- 📅 Daily update
- 🔍 Validation
- ✅ Success
- ⚠️ Warning
- ❌ Error

Watch logs for:
```
INFO:services.market_data_service: 📅 Running daily market data update...
INFO:services.market_data_service: ✅ SPY: Added 5 new bars
INFO:services.market_data_service: ✅ Daily update complete: 35 updated, 175 bars added
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Initial Population
- ~20-30 symbols
- 2 years of daily data
- ~500 bars per symbol
- Total: ~10,000-15,000 bars
- Time: 5-10 minutes (depends on API rate limits)

### Daily Update
- ~30-50 symbols
- 1-5 new bars per symbol (depending on trading days since last update)
- Total: 50-250 bars
- Time: 1-2 minutes

### Backtest Data Fetch
- Cache hit (90%+ data available): <100ms
- Cache miss (need API): 1-3 seconds
- Partial data fallback: <500ms

### Database Storage
- ~1KB per bar
- 1 year daily data for 50 symbols: ~12.5MB
- 5 years: ~62.5MB
- Negligible compared to typical database sizes

## Troubleshooting

### "No market data available" Error

**Symptoms:**
Backtest fails with error about missing market data.

**Solutions:**
1. **Wait for automatic update** - Daily update runs at 7 PM EST
2. **Manual population** - Call POST `/api/market-data/populate-historical-data`
3. **Check logs** - Look for initialization errors on startup
4. **Verify symbol** - Ensure symbol is valid and tradable
5. **Check Alpaca credentials** - Verify system environment variables are set

### Gaps in Historical Data

**Symptoms:**
Backtest results seem inconsistent or incomplete.

**Solutions:**
1. Wait for weekly validation (Sundays 2 AM EST)
2. Manually trigger validation (if endpoint available)
3. Check logs for gap detection messages
4. Re-populate specific symbols with longer date range

### Scheduler Not Running

**Symptoms:**
No daily updates, data becomes stale.

**Solutions:**
1. Check application logs for scheduler startup
2. Verify scheduler is started in main.py lifecycle
3. Restart application
4. Check for scheduler errors in logs

### API Rate Limits

**Symptoms:**
Frequent 429 errors in logs during data population.

**Solutions:**
1. Reduce number of symbols in CORE_SYMBOLS
2. Increase delay between API calls (if implementing batch logic)
3. Use cached data more aggressively (lower coverage threshold)
4. Upgrade Alpaca plan for higher rate limits

## Future Enhancements

1. **Multi-Timeframe Support**
   - Currently focused on 1Day data
   - Add support for 1Hour, 15Min for intraday strategies

2. **Crypto Support**
   - Extend to crypto pairs via Alpaca crypto API
   - Different caching strategy (24/7 markets)

3. **Data Quality Metrics**
   - Dashboard showing data completeness per symbol
   - Alert on data quality degradation
   - Automated data repair

4. **Smart Caching**
   - Pre-fetch data for popular symbols during off-hours
   - Predictive caching based on user patterns
   - Tiered storage (hot/warm/cold data)

5. **Alternative Data Sources**
   - Fallback to Polygon, IEX, or other providers
   - Data source prioritization
   - Cross-validation between sources

6. **Performance Optimization**
   - Parallel data fetching for multiple symbols
   - Batch inserts for faster population
   - Database partitioning for very large datasets

## Benefits

### For Users
- ✅ Backtests never fail due to missing data
- ✅ Clear feedback on data availability
- ✅ Faster backtest execution (cached data)
- ✅ Confidence in results (consistent data source)

### For System
- ✅ Reduced API calls (caching)
