## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Verify Environment Configuration

**On your deployment server:**

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /srv/brokernomex

# Verify .env file exists and has all required variables
cat .env | grep -E "ORDER_FILL_CHECK_INTERVAL|TRADE_SYNC_INTERVAL|GRID_MONITOR_INTERVAL|EXIT_MONITOR_INTERVAL"

# If missing, copy from example
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
# Then edit backend/.env with your actual values
```

**Critical Environment Variables:**
```bash
# Service Intervals (IMPORTANT: Use these safe values)
ORDER_FILL_CHECK_INTERVAL=120
TRADE_SYNC_INTERVAL=180
GRID_MONITOR_INTERVAL=180
EXIT_MONITOR_INTERVAL=90
IDLE_SLEEP_DURATION=300

# Error Handling
ERROR_THRESHOLD_WARNING=3
ERROR_THRESHOLD_PAUSE=5
ERROR_PAUSE_DURATION=300

# Database Optimization
MAX_QUERY_DAYS_BACK=7
MAX_QUERY_RESULTS=100

# Supabase (REQUIRED)
SUPABASE_URL=your_actual_url
SUPABASE_KEY=your_actual_key

# Alpaca (REQUIRED for market data)
ALPACA_API_KEY=your_actual_key
ALPACA_SECRET_KEY=your_actual_secret
```

### Step 2: Push to Main Branch

The deployment is automatic via GitHub Actions when you push to `main`:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy: Backend stabilization + TP/SL automation + Enhanced monitoring"
git push origin main
```

**What Happens Next:**
1. GitHub Actions runs pre-deployment validation
2. Docker image builds and pushes to GHCR
3. Image deploys to server via SSH
4. 30-second startup grace period
5. Health check runs (10 retries over 100 seconds)
6. Deployment succeeds or rolls back with logs

### Step 3: Monitor Deployment

**Watch GitHub Actions:**
- Go to: https://github.com/your-repo/actions
- Click on the latest "Deploy Backend" workflow
- Watch each step complete ‚úÖ

**If Deployment Fails:**
- Check the "Health check" step for error logs
- Backend logs will be shown automatically
- Common issues:
  - Environment variables not set ‚Üí Update .env on server
  - Database connection failed ‚Üí Check SUPABASE_URL/KEY
  - Services crashed ‚Üí Check for syntax errors

### Step 4: Verify Deployment Success

**SSH into your server:**

```bash
ssh your-user@your-server

# Check running containers
docker ps

# Check backend logs (should see services starting)
docker logs $(docker compose ps -q backend) --tail 100

# Look for these success messages:
# ‚úÖ "Order fill monitor started"
# ‚úÖ "Grid price monitor started"
# ‚úÖ "Position exit monitor started"
# ‚úÖ "Trading scheduler started"
```

**Test Health Endpoints:**

```bash
# Basic health check
curl https://api.handler.brokernomex.com/health

# Detailed health check (shows all service status)
curl https://api.handler.brokernomex.com/health/detailed | jq
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-29T19:00:00Z",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "services": {
    "scheduler": {
      "status": "running",
      "active_strategies": 0,
      "total_jobs": 3
    },
    "order_fill_monitor": {
      "status": "running",
      "check_interval": 120,
      "error_count": 0
    },
    "trade_sync": {
      "status": "running",
      "sync_interval": 180,
      "error_count": 0
    },
    "grid_monitor": {
      "status": "running",
      "check_interval": 180,
      "error_count": 0
    },
    "position_exit_monitor": {
      "status": "running",
      "check_interval": 90,
      "error_count": 0
    },
    "database": {
      "status": "connected"
    }
  }
}
```

## üîç Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Service Health Monitoring

**Check each service is running properly:**

```bash
# Watch logs in real-time
docker logs -f $(docker compose ps -q backend)

# Look for:
# - "üí§ System is idle" when no work (good!)
# - Service check intervals matching your .env
# - Error count staying at 0
# - No duplicate service messages
```

### 2. Test Strategy Creation

**Via Frontend:**
1. Log in to the platform
2. Go to "Strategies"
3. Create a new Spot Grid strategy
4. Configure TP/SL settings
5. Activate the strategy
6. Check that:
   - Strategy appears in active list
   - Scheduler picks it up within 5 minutes
   - Grid orders are placed correctly

**Verify in Database:**
```sql
-- Check active strategies
SELECT id, name, type, is_active, created_at
FROM trading_strategies
WHERE is_active = true;

-- Check grid orders
SELECT * FROM grid_orders
WHERE status = 'pending'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Check bot_positions
SELECT * FROM bot_positions
WHERE is_closed = false;
```

### 3. Monitor Risk Management

**Check risk events are being logged:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM bot_risk_events
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

**Test risk validation:**
1. Try to create a strategy with excessive position size
2. Should be rejected by risk validator
3. Check bot_risk_events table for rejection record

### 4. Test TP/SL Automation

**If you have paper trading enabled:**
1. Create a position with TP/SL configured
2. Watch position_exit_monitor logs
3. Manually adjust price in Alpaca paper trading
4. Verify position closes when TP/SL hit
5. Check exit_events table for records

---

## üìä Monitoring & Alerts

### Key Metrics to Watch

**Service Health:**
- Error counts (should stay at 0 or reset after successful cycles)
- API call frequency (should match configured intervals)
- Memory usage (check /health/detailed)
- CPU usage (check /health/detailed)

**Trading Activity:**
- Active strategies count
- Pending orders count
- Open positions count
- TP/SL triggers per day

**Database Performance:**
- Query response times
- Connection pool usage
- Table sizes over time

### Setting Up Monitoring Dashboards

**Recommended Tools:**
- **Grafana** - Visualize backend metrics
- **Prometheus** - Collect metrics from /health/detailed
- **Sentry** - Error tracking and alerts
- **LogTail** - Centralized log management

**Key Alerts to Configure:**
1. **Backend Down** - Health check fails
2. **High Error Count** - error_count > 5 for any service
3. **Service Not Running** - is_running = false
4. **Database Connection Lost** - database status ‚â† "connected"
5. **High Memory Usage** - memory_percent > 85%

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Problem: Backend Keeps Crashing

**Symptoms:**
- Container restarts frequently
- GitHub Actions health check fails
- Services showing high error counts

**Solutions:**
1. Check environment variables are set correctly
2. Verify database connection (SUPABASE_URL/KEY)
3. Check for syntax errors in Python files
4. Increase service intervals if still crashing
5. Enable emergency kill switch: `DISABLE_BACKGROUND_SERVICES=true`

### Problem: Orders Not Being Placed

**Symptoms:**
- Strategies active but no orders in grid_orders table
- Order fill monitor not detecting work

**Solutions:**
1. Check Alpaca credentials are valid
2. Verify strategy configuration is correct
3. Check grid price monitor is running
4. Ensure initial buy order completed
5. Check bot_risk_events for rejections

### Problem: TP/SL Not Triggering

**Symptoms:**
- Positions not closing at target prices
- exit_events table empty

**Solutions:**
1. Verify position_exit_monitor is running
2. Check positions have TP/SL prices set
3. Ensure current price reaching trigger levels
4. Check exit_monitor logs for errors
5. Verify Alpaca market data is available

### Problem: High API Usage

**Symptoms:**
- Alpaca rate limits hit
- Services running too frequently

**Solutions:**
1. Increase polling intervals in .env
2. Check for duplicate service instances
3. Enable idle detection (already done)
4. Monitor /health/detailed for check_interval values
5. Restart services if intervals not applying

---

## üîÑ Rollback Procedure

**If deployment fails completely:**

```bash
# SSH into server
ssh your-user@your-server
cd /srv/brokernomex

# Pull previous working image
docker compose pull backend

# Restart with previous version
docker compose up -d backend

# Monitor recovery
docker logs -f $(docker compose ps -q backend)
```

**Verify rollback success:**
```bash
curl https://api.handler.brokernomex.com/health
```
